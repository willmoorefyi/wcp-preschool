In our Teacher’s words

| Welcome to the 3s classroom at Walker Chapel Preschool, where the party never stops in our classroom!  I truly believe that “it takes a village…”, and we hope to be a part of yours!  We will support the children’s progress throughout their learning journey by continual observation, planning and evaluating.  The wellbeing of the children is of utmost importance!  Our teachers and the parents work alongside each other for the benefit of the child.  We strive to make school a place where children want to come. |

<br/>

##### Classroom Goals

* Foster a secure, motivating and fun environment to encourage children to achieve their full potential.
* We want children to want to come to school!
* We will build on what the children already know using hands-on activities, science experiments, arts & crafts, physical activity, emotional support and outdoor play.
* Some of our favorite topics to learn are ABCs, Numbers, Seasons, holidays and manners (ok maybe that is Mom & Dad’s favorite!).
