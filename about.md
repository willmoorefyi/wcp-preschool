## Our Preschool

Our preschool is a non profit, religiously exempt program and is subject to regulations by the State of Virginia and Arlington County.  The preschool program operates under the education committee of the outreach program provided by Walker Chapel Methodist Church.  The preschool is covered by the public liability insurance of Walker Chapel UMC.  An advisory committee comprised of staff, parents and church members administer the preschool program.

## Our Staff

All of our teachers and assistants have extensive educational backgrounds with experience as a teacher, parent or both.  They are certified in basic first aid and CPR.  In addition, the teachers at Walker Chapel all participate in frequent courses, workshops and conferences to keep current in their fields.  All staff is certified annually by a physician to be free from any injury which would prevent in the caring of children.
