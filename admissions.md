Classes will be filled to capacity with priority given to current families, siblings, alumni and Walker Chapel Church members.  Once a class is enrolled to capacity a waitlist will be maintained for the current academic year.  Applications received after the deadline will be added to the waitlist accordingly.  Should an opening occur, offerings will be made in accordance with the priority list and waitlist taking into account overriding factors such as gender and age balance.  Any final class placement is at the discretion of Walker Chapel Preschool Staff.

Notification of acceptance or placement onto the waitlist will be made in the month of February.  Specific dates will be announced during our open enrollment period.
Upon Acceptance, a deposit of one monthâ€™s tuition will be billed and collected.  This deposit will be applied to the June tuition for the upcoming school year and is refundable if your child decides not to attend before the start of school.

To request a tour of our facility please contact the Director, Pat McGeehan <mailto:wcpreschool@comcast.net>.
