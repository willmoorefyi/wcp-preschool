New Applicants may submit the registration form and Non-refundable application fee of $40.00 during our open enrollment period.

Our classes are filled to capacity for the 2018-2019 school year.  We will begin our open enrollment period for the 2019-2020 school year in January 2019, dates will be announced closer to the enrollment period.  Please contact the director, Pat McGeehan with specific questions.

Classes will be filled to capacity with priority given to current families, siblings, alumni and Walker Chapel Church members.  Once a class is enrolled to capacity a waitlist will be maintained for the current academic year.  Applications received after the deadline will be added to the waitlist accordingly.  Should an opening occur, offerings will be made in accordance with the priority list and waitlist taking into account overriding factors such as gender and age balance.  Any final class placement is at the discretion of Walker Chapel Preschool Staff.

Notification of acceptance or placement onto the waitlist will be made in the month of February.  Specific dates will be announced during our open enrollment period.
A registration fee of $35.00 must be provided to secure placement once accepted into a Walker Chapel Preschool class.  Additionally, a deposit of one monthâ€™s tuition will be billed and collected.  This deposit will be applied to the June tuition for the upcoming school year.

To request a tour of our facility please contact Director, Pat McGeehan at 703-538-5200 or <mailto:wcpreschool@comcast.net>.
