Our program fosters educational, physical, social and emotional development through both unstructured and organized play.

We are pleased to offer three age specific classes; 2 year olds, 3 year olds and Pre-K.  Our small classes allow for year over year growth with your child’s classmates and lasting friendships.  Our facility features large, sun filled classrooms, a fully fenced playground with several play structures, and a recreational room for indoor play.  Our curriculum is enhanced by daily craft projects, exploring music and instruments, weekly science experiments and weekly gross motor skill movement classes.  We are pleased to also offer an enrichment soccer program in the Fall and Spring which supports play outside of school with your child’s friends.
